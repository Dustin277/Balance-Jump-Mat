To add research just edit the txt file. if you need to upload anything only use PDF files! (PDFs cannot be added to txt file)
If you think of something important to research just let me know and ill add it to projects and create a tab under research for it.
Rules about research
1. Include links to references
2. Add a summary about what you discovered
3. Make it easy to read. we will all need to look over what you found for when we meet with the customer.
4. Any questions just ask in discord
5. So we know who is researching what, in "Projects" drag what you are researching to "in progress" and edit it to add ur name in it
